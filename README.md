# My first blog post Boston Seatle Airbnb

Project during Udacity Nanodegree Data science program (https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025).
The goal of the project is to write first blog post by doing some analysis in Seattle-Seattle Airbnb data.
The project will follow the CRISP-DM methodology.

The CRISP-DM structure used is:
- Business Understanding
- Data Understanding
- Prepare Data
- Data Modeling
- Evaluation

## Project motivation
This project is a part of Udacity nanodegree data science. The aim of the project is to get insights from Boston Seattle Airbnb data.
To achieve it, I try to answer three questions:
-  When are the peak season to visit Seattle and Boston?
-  How did some features (neighborhood, no. of bedrooms, etc) affect the price?
-  Using Machine Learning, which features are more important related to pricing?
## File description
In both cities (Seattle, Boston) we have three dataset:

- Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
- Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
- Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day
## Required libraries
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
## Summary
- The best time to visit Seattle is the June-August period. In other hand September-October is the best period to visit Boston
- The features like number of bedrooms, neighbourhood affect the price
- Bedrooms and Bathrooms are most important in model predicting price in Seattle. Private room are most important features in model predicting price in Boston.
## Acknowlegement
Thank you Airbnb for providing the data and Udacity for in-depth tutorials to make learning fun.
